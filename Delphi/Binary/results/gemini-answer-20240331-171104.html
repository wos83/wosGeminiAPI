            <p>Absolutely, here's how you can implement the desired functionality as a senior SQL developer using SQLite:</p>
<p><strong>1. Modifying the View:</strong></p>
<p>We need to modify the <code>VW_PRODUCT_V1</code> view to include a new calculated field for the time difference in seconds. Here's the updated code:</p>
<p><code>sql
CREATE VIEW VW_PRODUCT_V1 AS
SELECT P.ID_PROD AS PRODUCT_ID,
       C.DS_CATEG AS CATEGORY,
       B.DS_BRAND AS BRAND,
       M.DS_MODEL AS MODEL,
       P.DS_PROD AS PRODUCT_NAME,
       A.VL_OF AS VL_OF,
       A.VL_PER AS VL_PER,
       CASE WHEN A.VL_OF &gt; 0 THEN 
         ROUND((A.VL_PER - A.VL_OF) / A.VL_OF * 100, 2)
       ELSE
         0.00
       END AS DISCOUNT,       
       P.URL_IMG AS PRODUCT_IMAGE,
       A.URL_AFFILIATE AS AFFILIATE_LINK,
       P.REG_DH_INS AS REG_DH_INS,
       /* New field for time difference */
       CAST(strftime('%s', 'now') AS FLOAT) - CAST(strftime('%s', P.REG_DH_INS) AS FLOAT) AS TIME_DIFF_SEC
FROM TB_PROD P
INNER JOIN TB_CATEG C ON P.ID_CATEG = C.ID_CATEG
INNER JOIN TB_BRAND B ON P.ID_BRAND = B.ID_BRAND
LEFT JOIN TB_MODEL M ON P.ID_MODEL = M.ID_MODEL
LEFT JOIN TB_PROD_AFFILIATE PA ON P.ID_PROD = PA.ID_PROD
LEFT JOIN TB_AFFILIATE A ON PA.ID_AFFILIATE = A.ID_AFFILIATE
;</code></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We've added a new field named <code>TIME_DIFF_SEC</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>strftime('%s', 'now')</code> expression converts the current date and time to a Unix timestamp (seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC).</li>
<li>The <code>strftime('%s', P.REG_DH_INS)</code> expression converts the <code>REG_DH_INS</code> field (assuming it's a datetime format) to a Unix timestamp.</li>
<li>We subtract the timestamp of <code>REG_DH_INS</code> from the current timestamp and cast both values to FLOAT to ensure the result is a floating-point number representing the difference in seconds.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Implementation:</strong></p>
<p>Once you've modified the view definition, you can use the following query to retrieve product information along with the time difference:</p>
<p><code>sql
SELECT * FROM VW_PRODUCT_V1;</code></p>
<p>This query will return all the existing fields from the view along with the newly added <code>TIME_DIFF_SEC</code> field, which represents the time difference between the product registration date and time and the current time in seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the <code>REG_DH_INS</code> field is stored in a datetime format compatible with the <code>strftime</code> function.</li>
<li>You can modify the view name and field names as needed to fit your specific schema.</li>
</ul>
