            <p>Absolutely, here's how you can implement the desired functionality in SQLite as a senior SQL developer:</p>
<p><strong>1. Utilize Virtual Columns:</strong></p>
<p>Since you're working with a view (<code>VW_PRODUCT_V1</code>), directly adding a new column for the time difference isn't possible. However, SQLite offers virtual columns that allow calculations on the fly during data retrieval.</p>
<p>Here's the modified view definition:</p>
<p><code>sql
CREATE VIEW VW_PRODUCT_V1 AS
SELECT P.ID_PROD AS PRODUCT_ID,
       C.DS_CATEG AS CATEGORY,
       B.DS_BRAND AS BRAND,
       M.DS_MODEL AS MODEL,
       P.DS_PROD AS PRODUCT_NAME,
       A.VL_OF AS VL_OF,
       A.VL_PER AS VL_PER,
       CASE WHEN A.VL_OF &gt; 0 THEN 
         ROUND((A.VL_PER - A.VL_OF) / A.VL_OF * 100, 2)
       ELSE
         0.00
       END AS DISCOUNT,       
       P.URL_IMG AS PRODUCT_IMAGE,
       A.URL_AFFILIATE AS AFFILIATE_LINK,
       P.REG_DH_INS AS REG_DH_INS,
       /* New virtual column for time difference in seconds */
       CAST(strftime('%s', 'now') - strftime('%s', REG_DH_INS) AS INTEGER) AS TIME_DIFF_SEC
FROM TB_PROD P
INNER JOIN TB_CATEG C ON P.ID_CATEG = C.ID_CATEG
INNER JOIN TB_BRAND B ON P.ID_BRAND = B.ID_BRAND
LEFT JOIN TB_MODEL M ON P.ID_MODEL = M.ID_MODEL
LEFT JOIN TB_PROD_AFFILIATE PA ON P.ID_PROD = PA.ID_PROD
LEFT JOIN TB_AFFILIATE A ON PA.ID_AFFILIATE = A.ID_AFFILIATE;</code></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We've added a new virtual column named <code>TIME_DIFF_SEC</code>.</li>
<li><code>CAST</code> converts the result to an integer.</li>
<li><code>strftime('%s', 'now')</code> gets the current timestamp in Unix epoch format (seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC).</li>
<li><code>strftime('%s', REG_DH_INS)</code> gets the <code>REG_DH_INS</code> timestamp in Unix epoch format.</li>
<li>Subtracting these two values gives the time difference in seconds.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Accessing the Data:</strong></p>
<p>Now, when you query the <code>VW_PRODUCT_V1</code> view, you'll have access to the <code>TIME_DIFF_SEC</code> column. For example:</p>
<p><code>sql
SELECT * FROM VW_PRODUCT_V1 WHERE PRODUCT_ID = 123;</code></p>
<p>This will return all information about product ID 123, including the newly calculated <code>TIME_DIFF_SEC</code> representing the time difference in seconds since the product was inserted.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This approach avoids modifying the original table structure.</li>
<li>Remember that virtual columns are calculated during each query and aren't stored persistently.</li>
</ul>
<p>This solution provides a way to calculate the desired time difference within the view itself. If you need persistent storage of the time difference, you might consider creating a trigger or modifying the data insertion process to calculate and store the difference in a separate column within the <code>TB_PROD</code> table.</p>
