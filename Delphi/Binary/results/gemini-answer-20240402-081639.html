            <p>The error message you provided indicates that the query is trying to delete rows from the LOG table where the DATA column (presumably varchar) is being compared to a datetime value ('2010-06-31 23:59:59'). SQL Server is unable to convert all 'varchar' values in the DATA column to datetime because some might be invalid dates or not in the correct format.</p>
<p>Here's how we can fix the issue as a SQL Server DBA with over 30 years of experience:</p>
<p><strong>Option 1: Delete only valid dates</strong></p>
<p>This option ensures we only delete rows with valid dates in the DATA column.</p>
<p>```sql
USE INFOECIA_DEV_EDESOFT;</p>
<p>DELETE FROM INFOECIA_DEV_EDESOFT.dbo.LOG
WHERE 1 = 1
  AND TRY_CONVERT(datetime, DATA) &lt;= '2010-06-31 23:59:59';
```</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>TRY_CONVERT(datetime, DATA)</code> attempts to convert the DATA column value to datetime. If the conversion fails, it returns NULL.</li>
<li>The <code>WHERE</code> clause then checks if the converted value (or NULL) is less than or equal to the target date ('2010-06-31 23:59:59'). This ensures only valid dates are considered for deletion.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Option 2: Identify and handle invalid dates</strong></p>
<p>This option helps identify and potentially fix invalid dates before deletion.</p>
<p>```sql
USE INFOECIA_DEV_EDESOFT;</p>
<p>SELECT *
FROM INFOECIA_DEV_EDESOFT.dbo.LOG
WHERE 1 = 1
  AND TRY_CONVERT(datetime, DATA) IS NULL;
```</p>
<p>This query retrieves all rows where the DATA column cannot be converted to datetime. You can then analyze these records and decide how to handle them (e.g., update the format, exclude from deletion, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>Additional Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Backup:</strong> It's always recommended to have a recent backup of the database before running any deletion queries.</li>
<li><strong>Performance:</strong> Option 1 might be slower than the original query due to the conversion attempt. Consider the volume of data and potential impact on performance.</li>
<li><strong>Future Improvements:</strong> Depending on your data model, you might want to consider enforcing a proper date format for the DATA column to prevent similar issues in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this helps! Feel free to ask if you have any further questions.</p>
