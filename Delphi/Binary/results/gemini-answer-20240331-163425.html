            <p>Absolutely! Here's how you can create a view with a percentage field in SQLite, based on your existing table structure:</p>
<p><strong>1.  Create the View with Percentage Calculation:</strong></p>
<p><code>sql
CREATE VIEW VW_PRODUCT_V2 AS
SELECT P.ID_PROD AS PRODUCT_ID,
       C.DS_CATEG AS CATEGORY,
       B.DS_BRAND AS BRAND,
       M.DS_MODEL AS MODEL,
       P.DS_PROD AS PRODUCT_NAME,
       A.VL_OF AS VL_OF,
       A.VL_PER AS VL_PER,
       P.URL_IMG AS PRODUCT_IMAGE,
       A.URL_AFFILIATE AS AFFILIATE_LINK,
       P.REG_DH_INS AS REG_DH_INS,
       /* New field for percentage calculation */
       CASE
           WHEN A.VL_OF = 0 THEN 0  -- Handle division by zero
           ELSE (A.VL_PER - A.VL_OF) / A.VL_OF * 100
       END AS PERCENTAGE_DISCOUNT
FROM TB_PROD P
INNER JOIN TB_CATEG C ON P.ID_CATEG = C.ID_CATEG
INNER JOIN TB_BRAND B ON P.ID_BRAND = B.ID_BRAND
LEFT JOIN TB_MODEL M ON P.ID_MODEL = M.ID_MODEL
LEFT JOIN TB_PROD_AFFILIATE PA ON P.ID_PROD = PA.ID_PROD
LEFT JOIN TB_AFFILIATE A ON PA.ID_AFFILIATE = A.ID_AFFILIATE;</code></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We create a new view named <code>VW_PRODUCT_V2</code> based on the existing table joins.</li>
<li>We add a new field named <code>PERCENTAGE_DISCOUNT</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>CASE</code> statement handles the calculation:<ul>
<li>If <code>A.VL_OF</code> (original price) is zero, we set the percentage to zero to avoid division by zero errors.</li>
<li>Otherwise, we calculate the percentage discount by subtracting <code>A.VL_OF</code> from <code>A.VL_PER</code> and then dividing by <code>A.VL_OF</code>. Finally, we multiply by 100 to express it as a percentage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Implementing the View:</strong></p>
<p>Once you've created the view, you can use it in your queries just like a regular table. For example:</p>
<p><code>sql
SELECT PRODUCT_ID, PRODUCT_NAME, VL_OF, VL_PER, PERCENTAGE_DISCOUNT
FROM VW_PRODUCT_V2
WHERE PERCENTAGE_DISCOUNT &gt; 10;  -- Filter products with discount &gt; 10%</code></p>
<p>This query will retrieve product details along with the newly calculated <code>PERCENTAGE_DISCOUNT</code> for products with a discount greater than 10%.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Remember to replace <code>VW_PRODUCT_V1</code> with your actual view name if you've used a different one. </li>
<li>You can modify the filter condition in the example query to suit your specific needs.</li>
</ul>
