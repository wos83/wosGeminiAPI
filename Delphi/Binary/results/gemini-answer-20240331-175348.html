            <p>Absolutely! Here's how you can implement the desired functionality in SQLite using the provided table structure:</p>
<p><strong>1. Adding the Calculated Field:</strong></p>
<p>We'll modify the <code>VW_PRODUCT_V1</code> view to include a new field named <code>TIME_DIFF_HOURS</code>. This field will calculate the difference between the current time and the <code>REG_DH_INS</code> (registration date and time) in hours.</p>
<p>Here's the modified view definition:</p>
<p><code>sql
CREATE VIEW VW_PRODUCT_V1 AS
SELECT P.ID_PROD AS PRODUCT_ID,
       C.DS_CATEG AS CATEGORY,
       B.DS_BRAND AS BRAND,
       M.DS_MODEL AS MODEL,
       P.DS_PROD AS PRODUCT_NAME,
       A.VL_OF AS VL_OF,
       A.VL_PER AS VL_PER,
       CASE WHEN A.VL_OF &gt; 0 THEN 
         ROUND((A.VL_PER - A.VL_OF) / A.VL_OF * 100, 2)
       ELSE
         0.00
       END AS DISCOUNT,       
       P.URL_IMG AS PRODUCT_IMAGE,
       A.URL_AFFILIATE AS AFFILIATE_LINK,
       P.REG_DH_INS AS REG_DH_INS,
       /* New field to store time difference in hours */
       CAST(strftime('%s', 'now') AS FLOAT) - CAST(strftime('%s', P.REG_DH_INS) AS FLOAT) / 3600 AS TIME_DIFF_HOURS
FROM TB_PROD P
INNER JOIN TB_CATEG C ON P.ID_CATEG = C.ID_CATEG
INNER JOIN TB_BRAND B ON P.ID_BRAND = B.ID_BRAND
LEFT JOIN TB_MODEL M ON P.ID_MODEL = M.ID_MODEL
LEFT JOIN TB_PROD_AFFILIATE PA ON P.ID_PROD = PA.ID_PROD
LEFT JOIN TB_AFFILIATE A ON PA.ID_AFFILIATE = A.ID_AFFILIATE;</code></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>strftime('%s', 'now')</code>: This expression converts the current date and time to a Unix timestamp (seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC).</li>
<li><code>strftime('%s', P.REG_DH_INS)</code>: This converts the <code>REG_DH_INS</code> value (assuming it's a datetime format) to a Unix timestamp.</li>
<li><code>CAST(... AS FLOAT)</code>: We explicitly cast the timestamps to FLOAT for accurate calculations.</li>
<li>Subtraction and division by 3600: We subtract the timestamps to get the difference in seconds and then divide by 3600 to convert it to hours.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Implementation:</strong></p>
<p>You can implement this modification in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Using a database management tool:</strong> Open your SQLite database in a tool like SQLiteStudio or DB Browser for SQLite. Paste the modified view definition and execute it. This will recreate the view with the new <code>TIME_DIFF_HOURS</code> field.</li>
<li><strong>Using Python or other programming language:</strong> Connect to your SQLite database using a library like <code>sqlite3</code>. Execute a <code>DROP VIEW IF EXISTS VW_PRODUCT_V1</code> statement to drop the existing view (if needed) and then execute the modified view definition to create the new one.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Using the New Field:</strong></p>
<p>Once the view is updated, you can query <code>VW_PRODUCT_V1</code> and access the <code>TIME_DIFF_HOURS</code> field to see the time difference for each product in hours.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><code>sql
SELECT PRODUCT_NAME, TIME_DIFF_HOURS
FROM VW_PRODUCT_V1;</code></p>
<p>This will display the product name and the corresponding time difference in hours since it was registered.</p>
