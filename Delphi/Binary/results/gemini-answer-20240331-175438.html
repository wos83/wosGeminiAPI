            <p>Absolutely! Here's how you can implement the desired functionality in SQL using SQLite:</p>
<p><strong>1. Modifying the View:</strong></p>
<p>We can't directly add a new column to a view in SQLite. However, we can modify the existing view definition to include the calculation for the time difference. Here's the updated view:</p>
<p><code>sql
CREATE VIEW VW_PRODUCT_V2 AS
SELECT P.ID_PROD AS PRODUCT_ID,
       C.DS_CATEG AS CATEGORY,
       B.DS_BRAND AS BRAND,
       M.DS_MODEL AS MODEL,
       P.DS_PROD AS PRODUCT_NAME,
       A.VL_OF AS VL_OF,
       A.VL_PER AS VL_PER,
       CASE WHEN A.VL_OF &gt; 0 THEN 
         ROUND((A.VL_PER - A.VL_OF) / A.VL_OF * 100, 2)
       ELSE
         0.00
       END AS DISCOUNT,       
       P.URL_IMG AS PRODUCT_IMAGE,
       A.URL_AFFILIATE AS AFFILIATE_LINK,
       P.REG_DH_INS AS REG_DH_INS,
       /* New calculated field */
       CAST(strftime('%s', 'now') AS FLOAT) - CAST(strftime('%s', P.REG_DH_INS) AS FLOAT) / (60 * 60 * 24) AS DAYS_SINCE_INSERT
FROM TB_PROD P
INNER JOIN TB_CATEG C ON P.ID_CATEG = C.ID_CATEG
INNER JOIN TB_BRAND B ON P.ID_BRAND = B.ID_BRAND
LEFT JOIN TB_MODEL M ON P.ID_MODEL = M.ID_MODEL
LEFT JOIN TB_PROD_AFFILIATE PA ON P.ID_PROD = PA.ID_PROD
LEFT JOIN TB_AFFILIATE A ON PA.ID_AFFILIATE = A.ID_AFFILIATE;</code></p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We've added a new field named <code>DAYS_SINCE_INSERT</code>.</li>
<li><code>CAST(strftime('%s', 'now') AS FLOAT)</code> converts the current date and time to a Unix timestamp (seconds since epoch).</li>
<li><code>CAST(strftime('%s', P.REG_DH_INS) AS FLOAT)</code> converts the <code>REG_DH_INS</code> field (assuming it's a datetime format) to a Unix timestamp.</li>
<li>The difference between these timestamps is then divided by the number of seconds in a day (60 * 60 * 24) to get the difference in days.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Implementation:</strong></p>
<p>Once you've modified the view definition, you can use the new view <code>VW_PRODUCT_V2</code> in your queries to access the <code>DAYS_SINCE_INSERT</code> field. Here's an example:</p>
<p><code>sql
SELECT * FROM VW_PRODUCT_V2 WHERE DAYS_SINCE_INSERT &gt; 7;  -- Show products inserted more than 7 days ago</code></p>
<p>This query will retrieve all products from the view where the <code>DAYS_SINCE_INSERT</code> is greater than 7.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the <code>REG_DH_INS</code> field is stored in a format compatible with <code>strftime</code> (e.g., DATETIME).</li>
<li>You can modify the calculation in the <code>DAYS_SINCE_INSERT</code> field to return the difference in hours, minutes, or any other desired unit by adjusting the divisor.</li>
</ul>
